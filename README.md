The usage of GPS signals for positioning in buildings and indoor halls is impossible due to obstacles (walls, roofs), which interrupt the signals coming from the GPS satellites. What is more, the accuracy that is approximately 3.5 meters is good enough for outdoor applications, but for rooms it appears way too rough.

By creating stationary points with the help of Bluetooth Low Energy beacon devices it is possible to form more precise as well as full-coverage positioning in inaccessible to that moment places. These devices entered the market several years ago and are getting bigger popularity since then and their price is getting lower (10-20$ per device). 

The created project offers easily creating and positioning an indoor venue as all the data is being saved. That gives the final user a set of indoor maps with a main goal - orienting in the space. 

The advantages of the project are that it is open to changes by developers in order to improve its quality and free usage making it not connected to any given brand of BLE beacon producer.

The project can be used by innovators and companies in order to improve the services they offer and to collect data for the surrounding objects indoors.
